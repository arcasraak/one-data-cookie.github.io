**Conclusion.** The best setup really depends on the company size and priorities. You can get a feeling of how developed you're in the data space based on the type of questions you can answer today to your stakeholders, and the questions they ask but you still can't answer. Moving closer to the business is always a smart move. The data team cannot be centralized norr siloed, it will inevitably become a bottleneck. The number of Analytics Engineers needs to grow with the business, not reactively. In the long run, as things grow, the embedded way works best.
