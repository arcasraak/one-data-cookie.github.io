This is my **digital garden** – place for putting links, drafts, ideas; in particular anything related to the field of *data analytics*.

Keep in mind that this is *not* a blog. As it is the case for most of gardens, it's never finished, only loosely tended, and evolves with time.

Search through the notes below or just go to a [random note](/random).

<!---
To distinguish notes' maturity though, they are marked by *season*:
-   `winter` – just started
-   `spring` – in progress but with good content already
-   `summer` – very solid and happy about it
-   `autumn` – needs some rewriting so not visible #}
