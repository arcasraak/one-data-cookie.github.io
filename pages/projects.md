# If Now
I am currently putting together this very website, hence learning a bit about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and reminding myself of some CSS and HTML. Alongside that, I'm growing, improving, and automating my [digital garden](/notes). When I have some spare time, I [make data visualisation](/posts) in [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

See a few of my other projects below.

# Else
## Modern data stack for all
At the end of December 2021, I was playing around with some tools of the [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/). I ended up building a minimalistic and free version of it called Modern Data Stack for All at[`one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt) and [`one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset) whilst utilising [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Meltano](https://meltano.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

## Coalesce 2021
In December 2021, my colleagues from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and I had a chance to [talk](https://youtu.be/YA0yqYSs9BQ) at [Colaesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analaytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. We shared our analytics story and I showed a demo of [`dbt-superset-lineage`](https://github.com/slidoapp/dbt-superset-lineage), open-source CLI app coded in Python that connects [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/).

## Datavis meetups
At the beginning of 2021, I was at the inception of [datavis meetups](https://www.notion.so/vis-meetup-f23461cc5478422785292c28d2aa7b9e), hence I've been taking part and helping out since. We tend to meet in Brno and talk about anything related to data visualisation in quite a casual environment; featuring speakers from NGOs, print media, public sector, universities, and businesses.

## Data literacy at Masaryk University
In Novemeber 2021, [Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/), [Jáchym Kubáček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1chym-kub%C3%A1%C4%8Dek/), and myself put together a course on data literacy at the [Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en). The initial audience consisted mostly of librarians, however, we also created an [online course](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisk4future/datova-gramotnost) designed for and available to anyone.

## Data storytelling at Czechitas
In November 2021, I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to deliver a [talk on data storytelling](https://youtu.be/YoCbP-f_fEc) (using [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t72l01QatWym27fqkII6Lg6IbxugsUWD65huO-EgNYQ/edit?usp=sharing)) for their Data Academy in Brno.

## Data projects at Czechitas
During autumns 2021 and 2020, I mentored pairs of emerging data analysts and supported them in their final projects for [Czechitas'](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) Data Academy in Brno . In 2021, [Renáta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renata-turonova/) and Daniela had a look into the topic of [cybercrime](https://public.tableau.com/views/DAPROJEKTJakbezpenojevkyberprostoru/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
In 2020, [Adéla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adela-procha/) and [Elena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-gorokhova/) chose to explore [Brno's participatory budget](https://public.tableau.com/views/PaRo-grafy1/NavigationDB?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Standardisation of geo data at JIC
In October 2021, I helped out [JIC](https://www.jic.cz/en/), the Innovation Centre for South Moravian Region, with standardising their geo data from multiple sources. As a part of the process, I created [`geocode-mapycz`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/geocode-mapycz) that wraps JavaScript geocoding API of [Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/) in Python.
